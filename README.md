# Shift_Calculator
For the past year i'm working in shifts, each month i try to recalculate my salary that depends on the number of shifts I worked that month, 
and the most important factor is the time i worked in "shabat time". 
means that from a specific time in friday my hourly wage increase in 150%, and in specific time in saturday my wage is back to regular. 
I was wasting a lot of time each month to calculate my incom till i decided i can build a Python code that will do that for me.
I wrote a simple and smart scritp using: BeautifulSoup, requests, openpyxl, datetime, tkinter, prettytable, and pyinstaller modules.

Hope you liked it!
